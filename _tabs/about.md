Hi, my name is Filip Zverec, the founder of this blog The Tech Corner.

I’m a 26-year-old full time Sysadmin\Linux Administrator with a Master’s degree in Computer Networking.

I have started The Tech Corner as my personal blog where I can share my ideas, projects, guides, and discuss them with people with similar interests

I focus mainly on the system administration, automatization, virtualization and dev-ops technologies.



I’m also a tech enthusiast and I like to play with a tech. I’m running my own homelab with a Raspberry Pi as a DNS sink-hole. I’m running Proxmox server where I have several LXS containers like Bookstack, Netbird, jellyfish, Unifi controller…


As for my other hobbies, I enjoy calisthenics and climbing. From time to time I do photography and this blog. And last, but definitely not least, I like to play video games.
