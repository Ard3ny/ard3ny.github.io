Hi, my name is Filip, the founder of this blog The Tech Corner.

I’m a full time Sysadmin\Linux Administrator with a Master’s degree in Computer Networking.

I have started The Tech Corner as my personal blog where I can share my ideas, projects, guides, and discuss them with people with similar interests

I focus mainly on the system administration, automatization, virtualization and dev-ops technologies.


I’m also a tech enthusiast and I like to play with a tech a lot. I’m running my own homelab with a Raspberry Pi as a DNS sink-hole,Pi-KVM, proxmox server where I have several LXS containers like Bookstack, Netbird, jellyfish, Unifi controller…
