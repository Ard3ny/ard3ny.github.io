If you ever run an application or web server, you probably come across terms like load balancing, or high availability, failover etc.

These techniques are all concepts related to improving the reliability and performance of computer systems.

- **Load balancing** is the practice of distributing incoming network traffic across multiple servers to prevent any one server from being overwhelmed
- **High availability** refers to a system or application that is designed to be continuously available, with little to no downtime. This is typically achieved by deploying redundant components that can take over if the primary component fails
- **Failover** is a specific type of high availability strategy that involves automatically switching to a backup system when the primary system fails.
