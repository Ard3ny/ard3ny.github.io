# Introduction
This is a simple guide that shows you how to access your Jellyfin server using an external VPS with a Tailscale WireGuard tunnel for as little as $10/year.

## Advantages
* No public IP address needed
* Bypasses CGNAT of your ISP provider
* encrypted traffic (IPS can't collect data and is less likely to throttle you)
* total anonymity (with use of Duck DNS)

> This guide was tested using jellyfin running on the truenas, but the principle can be applied on any platform.

# Quick FAQ
## Why not just port-forward to proxy?
* The port-forward may not be possible if you don't have public IP address or your IPS is using CGNAT.

## Why not cloudflare tunnel?
* Streaming data from plex/jellyfin violated Cloudflare's terms of service.
* Cloudflare also [inspects](https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/network-analytics/reference/data-collection/) your traffic, which may not really be a good combination with you streaming "all your bought movies"
* By default the bandwidth is too small for movie streaming ** 

** this can be overcomed with some tinkering [A] (https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/what-is-a-cdn/) [B] (https://selfhosters.net/docker/plex/cloudflare/)

## Why not just Wireguard, netbird, twingate?
* While all of these VPN providers use wireguard as their tunnel technology, wireguard on it's own can be difficult to start with for beginners.
* Netbird, twingate are good alternatives to tailscale. In the end it's all about the preference and what you are already using.


## Prereq
### Choosing VPN provider
You can find best deals using site [lowendstock.com/](https://lowendstock.com/). 
While these providers can be on the more "suspicious" site of things, when you compare the pricing it's a nobrainer for VPN proxy like this. 
You can find VPS for as little as 10USD/year on Black fridays/Chinese New Year.

#### Tips
* use linux KVM platform
* choose IPV4 = 1 (we want the public IP address)
* probably a good thing to avoid Germany and Russia as an country origin of VPS provider


### Choosing Domain
We will need public domain for https traffic and ease of use. There are few options to go with

#### Use Duck DNS
Probably the easiest and the most anonymous way is using a [Duck DNS](https://www.duckdns.org/) 
If you are not familiar with DuckDns, it's simple, secure way of using public DNS [which will be yours](https://www.duckdns.org/faqs.jsp) for free. 
Sound almost to good to be true right?  Well, no one will guarantee you anything, but it's seems to be well established in the community by now.
With duck dns, you can create account and domain without any back-tracing information about you. 


#### Buy/Use an existing domain 
Use cloudflare or some other domain provider and buy something cheap for few USD/year.
If you already own a domain, just use that. In the end we only need one A record.


## How to
### Buy/setup VPS and open necessary ports

I'm not going to go through everthing with you, but when you choose the best deal for you, the process is very simular.
Register -> Choose VPS package deal -> Run

After that we need to open some ports
* INBOUND TCP 22 for SSH
* INBOUND TCP 80/443 for http/https
* INBOUND UDP 41641 for wireguard (tailscale)


> Outbound is usually all allowed by default.

### Point domain to IP of your VPS
After you've succesfully deployed your VPS, you should now know it's public IPv4. Copy that address and point your domain to IT

#### Truenas site
You can find whole truechart guide wich gets updated ever so often [here](https://truecharts.org/charts/stable/tailscale/How-To-Guide/), but if not available use mine bellow which should be sufficient.
* We will need to create [tailscale account](https://www.tailscale.com/)  
* For LAN access to your other truenas apps, you will need to set "sysctl" values in system settings. Go to System settings -> Advanced -> Add following and set them to "1" and "Enabled"
```bash
net.ipv4.ip_forward
```
```bash
net.ipv4.conf.all.src_valid_mark
```
![Sysctl values](/assets/img/posts/2024-01-04-Access-your-jellyfin-from-anywhere-with-tailscale-and-external-vps.md/sysctl.png)

* Prepare your tailscale Auth key (You can find them in your tailscale account -> Settings -> Keys )
![Tailscale auth key](/assets/img/posts/2024-01-04-Access-your-jellyfin-from-anywhere-with-tailscale-and-external-vps.md/tailscale_auth_key.png)

* In the truenas go to Apps -> Discover Apps -> Type in "tailscale". (Note: You may need truecharts repo to  by enabled)
Leave everything default except
Auth key
Userspace: Needs to be checked
Routes: "Your subnet range where jellyfin is running" (example 10.1.1.0/24)

![Tailscale setup example](/assets/img/posts/2024-01-04-Access-your-jellyfin-from-anywhere-with-tailscale-and-external-vps.md/tailscale_setup_example.png)

#### VPS site
SSh into your new VPS and setup tailscale 
```bash
curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh
```

This will prompt you to authenticate with your tailscale account.
The last thing is to tell the VPS tailscale client to accept routes from different tailscale clients. Without this the VPS won't see subnet 10.1.1.0/24 where jellyfin is running.

```bash
sudo tailscale up --accept-routes
```
#### Validate all necesarry tailscale/wireguard ports are open
By default wireguard requires one open UDP port (most commonly 51820) and without this connection/tunnel wouldn't work. But tailscale doesn't require you to open any port how is that possible?
Well the workaround/feature they use is called "Relayed connections" or how the call it "DERP".

If you are interested on how it works check these posts in their documentation [1](https://tailscale.com/kb/1257/connection-types) [2](https://tailscale.com/kb/1232/derp-servers)
You only need to know that if 
* you have specific/all UDP ports blocked
* you or your IPS is using [HARD NAT](https://tailscale.com/blog/how-nat-traversal-works)

DIRECT CONNECTION WILL NOT WORK and the tailscale will use DERP to relay traffic over their servers. We don't want to relay our traffic because is significantly limits the bandwidth.

> Again We don't want to relay our traffic over DERP because is significantly limits the bandwidth.
{: .prompt-warning }

I've measured the difference 5 Mbits/sec (DERP aka relayed) vs 250 Mbits/sec (direct)

To check if the connection is direct or relayed type this command into VPS

```bash
tailscale netcheck
```
```bash

                - hkg:         (Hong Kong)
```
We can see that "UDP: true" which means that connection with THIS client should be possible over direct connection. To further test this we will check connections between our two devices.


#### Validate wireguard connection between these 2 clients
You should now see both clients with their IP's in your tailscale Admin console. 
We can validate this connection with simple test.

Check the status and peers
```
tailscale status
```
```
100.x.x.x   reverse-proxy        test@    linux   -
100.x.x.x   truenas              test@    linux   active; 
```

Ping device
```
ping <IP of another device> 
```

You should see succesful ping output like this
```
PING 100.x.x.x (100.x.x.x) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 100.x.x.x: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=48.5 ms
64 bytes from 100.x.x.x: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=45.4 ms
64 bytes from 100.x.x.x: icmp_seq=3 ttl=64 time=44.9 ms
```

We can see connection is "direct". If it would be otherwise it would say "relayed over"   
example
```
pong from testmy (100.113.160.82) via DERP(nyc) in 130ms
pong from testmy (100.113.160.82) via DERP(nyc) in 37ms
pong from testmy (100.113.160.82) via DERP(nyc) in 50ms
```

And if we check tailscale status again we will see if the traffic is relayed or direct
```
100.x.x.x   reverse-proxy        test@    linux   -
100.x.x.x   truenas              test@    linux   active; direct 109.x.x.x:3637, tx 5082332 rx 163479060 
```

Again we can see connection is "direct". If it would be otherwise it would say "relayed over".


### Setup reverse proxy
This can be any reverse proxy of your choice, I'll be had great experience lately with caddy so I'be using that. 

> I had some freezing issues with nginx so maybe don't use that, but your experience may vary
{: .prompt-info }

Caddy is very easy to implement reverse proxy. By default it uses https and has build in certmanager. 

Install caddy package, start and enable the service
```
apt-get install caddy
sudo systemctl enable --now caddy
```

Configure site
```
vim /etc/caddy/Caddyfile
```
```
https://<yourDOMAINpointinOnThisServer>
reverse_proxy <jellyfinIPandPort>
```

example
```
https://jellyfin.duckdns.org
reverse_proxy 10.1.1.20:8096
```
> Note that I'm using  my subnet which I've configured and propagated to all tailscale clients.

### Verify 
* Check if the site is working
![Jellyfin](/assets/img/posts/2024-01-04-Access-your-jellyfin-from-anywhere-with-tailscale-and-external-vps.md/jellyfin.png)
* Try watching some content to see if you see any studdering. If you do tshoot the bandwidth of the tunnel with iperf3

One one side (VPS). Stop the caddy and run
```
iperf3 -s -p 443
```'

And on the other side (Jellyfin/truenas)
```
 iperf3 -c <yourDomain> -p 443
``` 

> You should at least 50+ Mbps for 4k movies
